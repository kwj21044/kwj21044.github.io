          <em><strong> "[I have] nothing against artificial light, but natural light is more interesting because its not perfect, its not entirely predictable"</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzo_Piano">Renzo Piano</a></em>
          <br><br>
          Light serves the basic necessary ingredient to human vision, but in many ways also defines
           the character and context of space. Visual impressions created by light can serve as a proper
           basis for evaluating, defining, and creating emotional and artistic expression through architecture.

          <br>
          Using natural light, or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylighting">daylighting”</a>, is the practice of using windows or other openings to provide
           internal lighting. Besides normal ground-level windows, natural lighting is often created with clerestory
            windows (windows that are placed high on top of a building) and skylights, as well as using large covered
             atrium spaces. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)">atrium</a> has increasingly become a popular architectural form, as they accentuate space
              and light, and allows users simulate an external environment while keeping dynamic interior spaces
               that emphasize comfort and usability. In terms of lighting, atria often find themselves at the
               intersection between natural and artificial lighting, as the architect attempts to harness
               massive amounts of sunlight while still maintaining control over the look and feel of the interior space.

          <span class ="title">Harvard Art Museums</span>

          <video controls class="embvideo" type="video/mp4" src="img/lightmachine.mp4"></video>
          <br>
          The <a href="http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/">Harvard Art Museums</a> are three art museums that integrated under a single institution in 1983.
          In 2014 the museum was renovated by architect Renzo Piano, and among other changes, Piano added a glass,
           pyramidal roof as part of the iconic Calderwood Courtyard. Piano had previously worked on buildings such as
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou">Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris</a>,
           <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard">the Shard</a> in London,
           and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> in NYC.
           <br><br>
           <img src="img/shard.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
           <br>
            As an architect
           immensely focused on using natural lighting in modern design, it's unsurprising the Museums have been acclaimed as
           as a "light machine", and a "glass lantern".
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0076.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          The focal point of the renovation is the iconic <a href="http://www.thecateredaffair.com/harvardartmuseums/calderwood-courtyard/">Calderwood Courtyard</a>, where the giant skylight manages to
          disperse light through the conservation lab, art study center, and central circulation corridors. However,
          as typical of atrium spaces, the natural light only plays one of many roles in the lighting design. The
          natural white light is juxtaposed against soft yellowy artificial lighting, creating a contrast between
          interior (the inner halls of the museum) and exterior (the courtyard).
          <br><br>
              <img src="img/DSC_0039.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
              <br>
              <img src="img/DSC_0042.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
              <br>
          The dangling lights in the courtyard point up as well as down, illuminating not only the floor below
          them but also the ceiling above, highlighting the interior “enclosed space” as opposed to the natural
          sky. There is a feeling of classical to modern as one traverses up the structure. The lower floors
          are made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travertine">travertine stone</a>, the middle floors use lights illuminating the ceiling to simulate
          the look of travertine, and the upper floors are almost fully while due to lack of lights reflecting
          on the ceiling, and the abundance of natural light hitting the walls.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/HAMLevels.png" class="imgType1"/>
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0047.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          While the first two floors use traditional columns and arches facing the courtyard, the upper floors
          use a sheet of glass to divide the galleries and the courtyard. The reflective glares of the glass
          enclosures serves to create a sense of control over the sky, containing light and reflecting it within
           a centerpiece at the top of the building.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0060.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          All courtyard lights either point directly up or down, emphasizing and focusing the user’s
          experience on the vertical nature of the atrium. Rather than natural light dispersing every
          which direction, one can more easily imagine a column of natural light falling directly on top
          of the yard.
          <br><br>

          <span class ="title">Contextual Experience</span>
          <br><br>
          The effect of Piano's glass lantern provides more meaning than that which meets the eye. The artist
          has stated that the key to museum buildings is openness, and inviting people to enjoy and share value
          with one another. In essence, lighting in museums points towards a loftier goal of cultural accessibility,
          which Piano makes a point to emphasize, versus traditional dark museums that may evoke a sense of intimidation.
          <br><br>
          Aside from saving energy, atria utilizing both natural and artificial lighting give user experience dedicated
          to a different experience of comfort. Rather than emphasizing ambient artificial lighting akin to candlelight,
          natural light presses the individual closer to the outside environment; it's unpredictable, imperfect, and
          constantly changing. It trades control for a type of primal comfort.
          <br><br>
          Museum's aren't the only spaces that emphasize such design - natural lighting and atria present itself across
          building design for workplaces, schools, homes, and many others.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0082.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          The <a href="http://scictr.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Science Center</a> was constructed in 1972 by ex-dean of GSD, Catalan architect, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Lluís_Sert">Josep Sert</a>.
          In an effort to break away from Georgian styles Harvard has focused on for many decades, Sert opted for
          plentiful natural light, including a center space much akin to the Calderwood Courtyard.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0084.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          Sert, similar to Piano, had envisioned the campus to be an integral part of the urban environment around it,
          hence the coolness of the lighting, and its, arguably heavier reliance on natural light than Piano's courtyard.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/DSC_0085.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          As expected from a science building, the architecture speaks volumes to a space that fosters modern open spaces for
          open space collaboration, innovation, and enlightenment.
          <br><br>
          <span class ="title">Openness in Culture</span>
          <br><br>
          In media, it seems like artists gravitate towards naturally lit, large spaces to conveny a range of emotions:
          grandiosity, innovation, and even fear, or exoticism.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/roommovie.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          In the 2015 movie Room, the protagonists are trapped in a small claustrophobic space, with nothing but a skylight.
          Natural light is seen as hope, escape, mystery.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/bondmovie.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/matrixmovie.jpg" class="imgType1"/>
          <br>
          The Matrix and Skyfall use ideas of open space to express anxiety, excitement, and even fear.
